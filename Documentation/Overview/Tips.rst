Travel pages by keyboard
========================

Each documentation knows about a linear sequence of its pages. Use "Next"
and "Previous" to move forwards or backwards in that sequence. Or, if
available, use "Up" to step back to the next higher level of page
hierarchy. The good news is that these functions are also available 
from the keyboard by the "access keys".

What's an "access key"?
-----------------------

  In a web browser, an `access key or accesskey`__ allows a computer 
  user immediately to jump to a specific part of a web page via the 
  keyboard.

Unfortunately each browser seems to use `its own modifier`__ to
make the access key work.
In most web browsers the user invokes the access key by pressing 
the "modifier (which often is Alt or Ctrl) simultaneously with the 
appropriate character on the keyboard. So we have for example:
