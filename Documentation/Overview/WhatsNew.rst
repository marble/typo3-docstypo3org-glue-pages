What's new?
==============================

Content news
============

New: "What's new?" page
-----------------------

2012-12-26.
Now there's a "What's new page?" at docs.typo3.org that keeps you
informed about proceedings in content and layout.



Spellings, Maintenance Guide
----------------------------

2012-12-21.
In the menu it's now "API" instead of "Api" and "TypoScript" instead of 
"Typoscript". We don't have an "Administrator's Guide". Instead a 
:ref:`t3maintenance:start` is on the way. Pointers were adjusted 
accordingly.


Layout news
===========

Fixed flyout menu at the left 
-----------------------------

2012-12-26.
An additional flyout menu with links to anchors within the current
page is now constantly available from a fixed position at the
left border of the browser window. Example: Hover
over the outlined area at the left of the browser window.



One central file for the main menu
----------------------------------

2012-12-25.
The top menu is now loaded from a single javascript file which is
common to all pages and can be changed easily. Existing manuals don't 
need to be rerendered to have an up to date menu.



Automatic "shrink to fit" for images
------------------------------------

2012-12-24. `This post`__ has a first info. More documentation is in 
preparation.

__ http://lists.typo3.org/pipermail/typo3-project-documentation/2012-December/004315.html

1. Watch for example `this page`__.
2. Select "adaptive" layout.
3. Resize the width of your browser window.

How to make small screenshots look nice
---------------------------------------

2012-12-18: `first info and comments`__, example__

__ http://lists.typo3.org/pipermail/typo3-project-documentation/2012-December/004288.html

Updated recommendation: **Do** use class "screenshot-detail", **do not**
use "screenshot-fullsize".
